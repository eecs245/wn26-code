    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Chapter 2.1](https://notes.eecs245.org/simple-linear-regression/overview/), we explored simple linear regression, and defined it as the problem of finding the values of $w_0$ (intercept) and $w_1$ (slope) that minimize mean squared error for the model $h(x_i) = w_0 + w_1 x_i$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal slope and intercept were denoted $w_1^*$ and $w_0^*$, respectively, and have closed-form solutions that are first stated in [Chapter 2.1](https://notes.eecs245.org/simple-linear-regression/overview/) and proved in [Chapter 2.3](https://notes.eecs245.org/simple-linear-regression/finding-optimal-parameters/). When using squared loss to find our optimal parameters, linear regression is often called \"least squares regression.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "**What if we used a different loss function instead?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, we'll implement another type of linear regression: simple least absolute deviation (LAD) regression. LAD regression uses absolute loss to measure the quality of predictions, rather than squared loss. Put another way, to find the optimal slope $w_1^*$ and intercept $w_0^*$ for LAD regression, we minimize mean absolute error:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",

    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"simple\" in \"simple LAD\" refers to the fact that our hypothesis function $h(x_i) = w_0 + w_1 x_i$, like in regular simple linear regression, only uses a single input feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since absolute value functions are not differentiable, we cannot just take partial derivatives of $R_{\\text{abs}}$ with respect to $w_0$ and $w_1$, set them equal to zero, and solve for the values of $w_0$ and $w_1$, as we did to minimize $R_{\\text{sq}}$. This was more tractable in the constant model case, but in general it'll require techniques beyond the scope of this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to generate the optimal LAD regression line we are going to leverage the following theorem (which, luckily, we won't need to prove):\n",
    "\n",
    "> The regression model that minimizes mean absolute error passes directly through at least $k$ points, where $k$ is the number of parameters of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This theorem is useful to us because it allows us to adopt a very conceptually simple, albeit not very efficient, strategy to compute an optimal simple LAD regression line. Since our hypothesis function has $k = 2$ parameters, an intercept $w_0$ and a slope $w_1$, we can simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate all possible pairs of 2 points. We know that the optimal LAD line will pass through at least one of these pairs.\n",
    "1. For each pair of points:\n",
    "    1. Find the equation of the line that passes through the pair. Denote the intercept and slope of this line $w_0$ and $w_1$, respectively.\n",
    "    1. Compute the mean absolute error of the line with intercept $w_0$ and slope $w_1$, i.e. compute $R_\\text{abs}(w_0, w_1)$.\n",
    "1. Return the $(w_0, w_1)$ combination with the minimum value of $R_\\text{abs}(w_0, w_1)$. By the above theorem, this line is guaranteed to minimize mean absolute error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that unlike with simple linear regression, the optimal simple LAD regression line may not be unique!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, you will ultimately complete the implementation of the `SimpleLAD` **class**, which can be used as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> model = SimpleLAD()\n",
    ">>> model.fit([1, 2, -1, 4], [15, 6, 7, 8])\n",

    "You might recognize this syntax from Lab 2, as this is how model classes work in `sklearn`. Indeed, part of the point of this problem is to get you familarized with how to use machine learning models in code (in addition to understanding how they might be implemented).\n",
