    "\n",
    "That is, suppose we're given a new individual, $\\vec{x}_\\text{new} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\text{Glucose}_\\text{new} \\\\ \\text{BMI}_\\text{new} \\end{bmatrix}$. The $k$-nearest neighbors classifier ($k$-NN for short) classifies $\\vec{x}_\\text{new}$ by:\n",

    "1. Predicting that $\\vec{x}_\\text{new}$ belongs to the **most common class** among those $k$ closest points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose $k = 6$. If, among the 6 closest points to $\\vec{x}_\\text{new}$, there are <b><span style=\"color:blue\">4 blue</span></b> and <b><span style=\"color:orange\">2 orange</span></b> points, we'd predict <b><span style=\"color:blue\">blue (diabetes)</span></b>. If there are ties, we'll have to break them somehow; read [here](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/144718/how-does-scikit-learn-resolve-ties-in-the-knn-classification) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions you may have:\n",
    "- How do we measure \"closeness\" between two points? Suppose $\\vec x_i$ and $\\vec x_j$ are two vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. To measure how close they are, we can compute the **norm (i.e. length) of the difference between the two vectors**. (Refer to [Chapter 3.2](https://notes.eecs245.org/vectors/norms/) for a discussion of norms.) There are multiple vector norms, which means we have a choice to make:\n",
    "    $$\\text{using the $L_2$ norm: } \\text{dist}(\\vec x_i, \\vec x_j) = \\|\\vec x_i - \\vec x_j\\|_2 = \\sqrt{\\sum_{d=1}^n (\\text{component $d$ of } \\vec x_i - \\text{component $d$ of } \\vec x_j)^2}$$\n",
    "    $$\\text{using the $L_1$ norm: } \\text{dist}(\\vec x_i, \\vec x_j) = \\|\\vec x_i - \\vec x_j\\|_1 = \\sum_{d=1}^n |\\text{component $d$ of } \\vec x_i - \\text{component $d$ of } \\vec x_j|$$\n",
    "    For instance, if $\\vec x_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\vec x_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 6 \\end{bmatrix}$, then $\\|\\vec x_1 - \\vec x_2\\|_2 = 5$ and $\\|\\vec x_1 - \\vec x_2\\|_1 = 7$.\n",
    "- What value of $k$ should we use, i.e., how many neighbors should we look at? The value of $k$ is called a **hyperparameter**, because it's a parameter of the model that we get to choose (unlike, say, the $w_0$'s and $w_1$'s in simple linear regression, which are found through minimizing mean squared error, not by us picking them). Soon, we'll see how different values of $k$ can lead to different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem will walk you through implementing the $k$-nearest neighbors classifier. By the end, you'll implement a `KNNClassifier` class (similar to the `SimpleLAD` class from Homework 2) that you can use to classify new points."
