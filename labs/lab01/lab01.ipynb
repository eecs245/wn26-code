    "2. Read through the notebook to make sure everything is fine and all tests passed.\n",

    "4. Download your notebook using `File -> Download`, then upload your notebook to Gradescope under \"Lab 1\".\n",
    "5. Stick around for a few minutes while the Gradescope autograder grades your work. Make sure you see that all **public tests** have passed on Gradescope.\n",
